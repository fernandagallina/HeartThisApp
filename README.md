Android app using HeartThisAt API
Some further details about the project: I used 6 third libraries. Dagger2 for dependency injection, Butterknife for view injection, Retrofit2 and OkHttp for REST calls, Gson to convert objects in their Json representation and Picasso to facilitate the image loading.
